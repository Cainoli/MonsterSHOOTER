# MonsterShooter
Welcome to the **MonsterShooter** source code! This is an approximate game project in the genre of arcade action with RPG elements, created in collaboration with @Aetherverse. We plan to keep updating it in future releases to showcase our latest best practices. While the released feature set is only a basic foundation, this game is intended to be an excellent starting point for game developers to create new projects, as well as a practical learning resource.

## Branches
*  Numbered branches identify past and upcoming official releases, and the **release** branch always reflects the current official release. These are extensively tested. We work hard to make releases stable and reliable.

*  Most active development on Monster Shooter happens in the **master** branch. This branch reflects the cutting edge of the game and may be buggy â€” it may not even compile.

Other short-lived branches may pop-up from time to time as we stabilize new releases or hotfixes.
